# Less-Heart

Hi My name is Damion Ashley i am from Denver Colorado, I have always had a passion for java and app design. Though i have never successfuly asserted my knowledge towards any kind of creating except now. I have some exsperience with graphic design and code input and i am a fast learner, plus I'm a hands on kind of guy, though i may not get the full understanding of the tutorial. i will get the nesseccities needed to create my app. I hope this projects turns into something that can keep me busy and also catch an eye or two from somreonr in the upper offices, (Fingers crossed.)
